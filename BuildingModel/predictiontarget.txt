The chosen predicted target is Price. The price of a house is a variable, i.e, it changes based on the market, the
seasons and a variety of other factors. The other attributes like the location of the houses, the number of rooms, 
bedrooms or bathroom and the buildingarea are fixed quantities. Hence, it is most benificial to predict the price of 
the house. The trends in the price can be analysed and the price for a given house can be predicted using a linear
regression model.
